# PDF Version vs web version
Uses the `pagedown` package with a copy of the css file from the web version with minor changes:

The fonts are controlled by the css files meaning you can have different fonts (and other graphical properties) for each document.

PDF version (pdf.css):
```
body {
  font-size: 1rem; /* Changed */
  text-align: left; /* Changed */
}
```

Original web version (style.css): 
```
body {
  font-size: 1.6rem; 
  text-align: justify;
}
```




```{r child = 'body.Rmd'}
```
