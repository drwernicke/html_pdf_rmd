# PDF Version vs web version
Uses the `pagedown` package with a copy of the css file from the web version with minor changes:

Would very much like to be able to change/specify font family for pdf version. Should it be done in the pdf.css or elsewhere? This sentence were also written to test a pull request to Christian. I forked the repo from Christian, created a "test" branch, and made this edit and will now do a pull request. Then I will wait for something to happen.

PDF version (pdf.css):
```
body {
  font-size: 1rem; /* Changed */
  text-align: left; /* Changed */
}
```

Original web version (style.css): 
```
body {
  font-size: 1.6rem; 
  text-align: justify;
}
```




```{r child = 'body.Rmd'}
```
